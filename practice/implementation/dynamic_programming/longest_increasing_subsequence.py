DP - Longest Increasing Subsequence (medium)

Description:
Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly 
increasing subsequence.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting 
some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. 
For example, [3,6,2,7] is a subsequence of the array [0,3,1,6,2,2,7].

Example:
Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore 
the length is 4.
